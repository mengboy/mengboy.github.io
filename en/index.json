In single-node applications, we use synchronized or ReentrantLock to solve concurrency issues. But in distributed systems:\nMultiple service instances access shared resources simultaneously Database transactions cannot cover cross-service business logic Cache-database consistency requires coordination At this point, distributed locks are needed to ensure that only one thread/process can execute critical code sections at the same time.\nBasic Implementation: SETNX + EXPIRE The simplest implementation:\n# Acquire lock SETNX lock_key 1 EXPIRE lock_key 30 # Release lock DEL lock_key Problems:\nAtomicity issue: SETNX and EXPIRE are not atomic operations Deadlock risk: If the service crashes after acquiring the lock, the lock will never be released Misdeletion risk: Releasing the lock might delete another client\u0026rsquo;s lock Improved Solution: SET NX PX + Lua Script # Acquire lock (atomic operation) SET lock_key client_id NX PX 30000 # Release lock (Lua script ensures atomicity) if redis.call(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then return redis.call(\u0026#34;DEL\u0026#34;, KEYS[1]) else return 0 end Advantages:\nSET command\u0026rsquo;s NX and PX parameters ensure atomicity Lua script guarantees atomic release of lock client_id prevents misdeletion of other clients\u0026rsquo; locks Production-Grade Solutions Solution 1: Redisson (Recommended) Redisson provides mature distributed lock implementation:\nRLock lock = redisson.getLock(\u0026#34;myLock\u0026#34;); lock.lock(); // Automatic renewal try { // Business logic } finally { lock.unlock(); } Features:\nAutomatic renewal (Watchdog mechanism) Reentrant locks Fair/non-fair locks Timeout auto-release Solution 2: Redisson + Spring Boot # application.yml redisson: config: | singleServerConfig: address: \u0026#34;redis://127.0.0.1:6379\u0026#34; connectionMinimumIdleSize: 10 connectionPoolSize: 64 database: 0 idleConnectionTimeout: 10000 pingTimeout: 1000 connectTimeout: 10000 timeout: 3000 retryAttempts: 3 retryInterval: 1500 Common Misuse Cases Case 1: Unreasonable Lock Expiration Time Problem: Setting too short expiration time Consequence: Business logic not completed before lock expires Solution: Set based on maximum business execution time + safety margin Case 2: Ignoring Lock Renewal Problem: Long-running tasks where lock expires Consequence: Other clients acquire lock and modify data Solution: Use automatic renewal mechanism or manual renewal Case 3: Ignoring Network Partition Issues Problem: Network jitter causes client to think lock acquisition succeeded Consequence: Split-brain problem, multiple clients think they hold the lock Solution: Use Redlock algorithm or strong consistency storage Best Practice Checklist Must set timeout: Prevent deadlocks Use unique identifier: Avoid misdeleting other clients\u0026rsquo; locks Atomic operations: Both lock acquisition and release must be atomic Consider auto-renewal: For long-running tasks Monitoring \u0026amp; alerts: Lock acquisition failure rate, waiting time, etc. Fallback strategy: Backup strategy when lock service is unavailable Performance Comparison Test Solution Lock Acquisition Time Lock Release Time Reliability Use Case Native SETNX 0.5ms 0.3ms Low Test environment SET NX PX 0.6ms 0.4ms Medium Simple business Redisson 1.2ms 0.8ms High Production environment Redlock 2.5ms 1.5ms Very High Financial-grade systems Conclusion Redis distributed locks are not just simple \u0026ldquo;lock-acquire-lock-release\u0026rdquo; operations, but a complete concurrency control solution.

Responses API + MCP is better for multi-step, multi-tool, stateful workflows. What you need is not just better prompting, but a better tool protocol and workflow architecture. 1) Clarify the boundary: Function Calling vs MCP Typical function-calling pain points At scale, teams usually hit these issues:\nTool definitions are scattered across business code. Cross-tool orchestration needs custom state machines. Permissions and observability are inconsistent. What MCP actually fixes MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard layer for tool integration:\nTool discovery Unified invocation schema Better isolation and permission boundaries Traceable tool execution 2) MVP architecture that works Start with a simple three-layer setup:\nOrchestrator: business entry point Model Layer: Responses API for reasoning and routing Tool Layer: MCP servers exposing retrieval/read/write/ops tools Flow:\nUser task enters orchestrator Model decomposes task and selects tools MCP tools return structured results Model continues or finalizes output 3) Reusable calling skeleton Simplified pseudo-code (focus on shape, not SDK details):\nfrom openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI() tools = [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;mcp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;server_label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;docs\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;server_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;mcp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;server_label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ops\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;server_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://127.0.0.1:8081/mcp\u0026#34; } ] resp = client.responses.create( model=\u0026#34;gpt-5\u0026#34;, input=\u0026#34;Find root cause of last night\u0026#39;s failed deployment and propose a fix plan\u0026#34;, tools=tools ) print(resp.output_text) Add a hard safety policy early:\nPOLICY = { \u0026#34;dangerous_actions_require_approval\u0026#34;: True, \u0026#34;readonly_tools_default\u0026#34;: True, \u0026#34;max_tool_hops\u0026#34;: 8 } 4) Reliability and debugging (the part most teams skip) 1) Enforce structured JSON output from tools Do not return free-form text only.

Bad tool design stays bad.\nMistake 2: Adding too many tools too early More tools can reduce routing stability. Start with 3–5 high-value tools.\nMistake 3: Measuring demo quality, not long-run reliability Track these metrics:\nMulti-step task completion rate Tool failure rate Average tool hops Human takeover rate 6) Minimum practical rollout checklist Pick one narrow scenario (e.g., deploy incident triage). Integrate only three MCP tools (logs, config read, fix suggestion). Use Responses API for decomposition and routing. Gate dangerous actions with human approval. Run for one week and iterate on failure paths.

To understand what is truly changing, it helps to place today inside the longer history of software engineering.\nThis article walks through the major stages of software engineering and ends with the AI-era variables and a simple checklist so you can map your current problems to the right time scale.\nBackground: From “Writing Code” to “Engineering Delivery” Software engineering is not just about writing code. It is about delivering reliable software under controlled cost and risk. From the beginning, that required teams, coordination, and method, not solo heroics.\nStages and Turning Points Stage Time Primary Traits Keywords Early Exploration 1940s-1960s Hardware-led, manual control of complexity Assembly, batch processing, early OS Software Crisis and Discipline 1968-1970s Scale out of control, delays, cost overruns Software crisis, structured methods, specs Standardization 1980s Process and quality management CMM, QA, structured design Object Orientation and Reuse 1990s Better modeling for complex systems OOP, UML, design patterns, components Internet and Agile 2000s Faster iteration and delivery cadence Scrum, XP, continuous integration Cloud Native and DevOps 2010s Infra automation and observability Microservices, containers, SRE, IaC AI Co-Creation 2020s- Shifts in collaboration across the lifecycle LLM, Copilot, evaluation, governance Most turning points fall into three categories:\nScale: moving from small teams to large coordination, driving process. Complexity: broader system boundaries, driving abstraction and reuse. Efficiency: faster delivery expectations, driving automation and platforms. Typical Evolution of Engineering Methods A short view of the main flow models:\nWaterfall: clear phase boundaries and documentation, good for stable requirements. Iterative/Incremental: staged delivery to reduce big-bang risk. Agile: feedback-focused, shorter cycles. DevOps/SRE: delivery and operations together, automation for stability. Platform Engineering: shared capabilities as a platform to raise org efficiency. New Variables in the AI Era AI does not replace engineering methods; it changes knowledge-heavy steps into collaborative, amplifiable, and governance-heavy work:\nRequirements and design: higher dependency on context quality; prompts become a new type of spec. Coding: faster generation, but consistency and constraints matter more. Testing: easier to generate cases, but coverage and quality still need human control. Operations: faster diagnosis and runbook generation, still requires strong observability. Governance: data security, compliance, and evaluation become new engineering overhead. How AI Participates in Real Workflows Treat AI as a structured artifact generator, not a free-form replacement.\nRequirements and planning: clarify needs, fill exception flows, draft acceptance criteria lists. Solutions and design: produce option comparisons, risk checklists, and API contract drafts. Development: generate module-level code under explicit inputs, outputs, and boundaries. Testing: generate edge and exception case drafts, humans curate critical paths. Release and operations: impact analysis, log summaries, and incident investigation drafts. After adoption, keep three controls: traceability (prompts and model version), evaluation (correctness/consistency/usability), and constraints (boundaries and compliance).\nVerify: Which Stage Is Your Team In? Use this checklist for a quick self-assessment:\nDo you have a stable mechanism for requirements and change control? Do you have CI/CD with rollback strategy? Do you enforce automated tests and quality gates on critical paths? Do you have unified monitoring, logging, and alerting? Do you evaluate AI outputs with explicit quality baselines (accuracy, explainability, compliance)? If the first four are weak, AI will not produce stable gains. If the fifth is missing, AI can introduce new risks.\nSummary Software engineering history is a line of “scaled collaboration + complexity control + delivery efficiency.” AI pushes that line into a new stage: higher productivity, denser collaboration, and stronger governance needs.

Cursor, the AI-first code editor, can further enhance this setup by integrating with Model Control Program (MCP) servers. Running these MCP servers directly within your WSL environment keeps your development workflow clean and consolidated. This guide will walk you through configuring Cursor to use MCP servers running in WSL.\nWhat is MCP? MCP (Model Control Protocol) is a protocol that allows AI models, like those in Cursor, to securely interact with various tools and data sources. These tools, or \u0026ldquo;MCP servers,\u0026rdquo; can perform actions like web searches, file system operations, or even browser interactions, providing the AI with a richer context and more capabilities.\nWhy Run MCP Servers in WSL? Consistency: Keep your entire development toolchain within the Linux environment you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with. Simplified Paths: Avoid complexities with Windows vs. Linux path translations for tools that access the file system. Leverage Linux-specific Tools: Some MCP servers or their dependencies might work better or exclusively in a Linux environment. Containment: Keep Node.js versions and other dependencies required by MCP servers managed within WSL, separate from your Windows system. Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure you have the following:\nWSL Installed: A working WSL installation with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu). Node.js and npx in WSL: Node.js and npx (which comes with npm) must be installed inside your WSL distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended to use a version manager like nvm (Node Version Manager) within WSL to manage Node.js versions. This helps avoid permission issues and allows easy switching between Node.js versions. Cursor IDE: Installed on your Windows machine. Configuration Steps The key to running MCP servers in WSL is to tell Cursor how to launch them using the WSL command-line interface. This is done by editing the mcp.json file.\n1. Locate or Create mcp.json Cursor stores its MCP server configurations in a file named mcp.json. On Windows, you can typically find this file in:\nC:\\\\Users\\\\\u0026lt;YourUserName\u0026gt;\\\\.cursor\\\\mcp.json\nReplace \u0026lt;YourUserName\u0026gt; with your actual Windows username. If the file or .cursor directory doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, Cursor might create it when you first try to add an MCP server through its UI, or you might need to create it manually.\n2. Understanding mcp.json Structure The mcp.json file contains a JSON object, where each key under mcpServers represents a configured MCP server. Here\u0026rsquo;s a basic structure:\n{ \u0026#34;mcpServers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;your-mcp-server-name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;executable_or_wsl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;argument1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;argument2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;command_to_run_in_wsl\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true // Other options like \u0026#34;env\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;workingDirectory\u0026#34; can also be specified } } } 3. Core Configuration for WSL To run an MCP server (which is typically an npx command) within WSL, you\u0026rsquo;ll configure a server entry as follows:\n\u0026quot;command\u0026quot;: Set this to \u0026quot;wsl\u0026quot;.\n\u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: This will be an array. The first elements tell wsl which shell to use and to execute a command string. The final element is the command string itself.\nExample for bash: [\u0026quot;bash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;npx @some-mcp/package --port {{port}}\u0026quot;] Example for zsh: [\u0026quot;zsh\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;npx @some-mcp/package --port {{port}}\u0026quot;] (Note: {{port}} is a placeholder that Cursor often uses to inject a port number for the MCP server to listen on. Check the specific MCP server\u0026rsquo;s documentation if it requires a port.)\n4. Handling Shell Environment (Crucial for nvm users) A common issue is that when Cursor invokes wsl ... npx ..., the npx command might not be found, or it might not use the Node.js version you expect (especially if you use nvm). This is because the non-interactive shell session started by wsl might not load your full shell profile (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc), where nvm and other PATH modifications are usually configured.\nHere are two reliable solutions:\nSolution A: Using a Shell Script (Recommended for Clarity)\nThis method involves creating a small shell script within your WSL environment that sets up the environment and then runs the npx command.\nCreate the Script in WSL: Open your WSL terminal and create a script, for example, ~/run_browsermcp.sh:\n#!/bin/zsh # Or use #!/bin/bash if you use bash # Source your shell\u0026#39;s rc file to load nvm and other environment settings # Adjust the path to your rc file if necessary if [ -f \u0026#34;$HOME/.zshrc\u0026#34; ]; then source \u0026#34;$HOME/.zshrc\u0026#34; elif [ -f \u0026#34;$HOME/.bashrc\u0026#34; ]; then source \u0026#34;$HOME/.bashrc\u0026#34; fi # For debugging: check which npx is being used and Node version # which npx # node -v # The actual npx command for your MCP server # Replace with the specific MCP server command you need npx @browsermcp/mcp@latest --port {{port}} a example:\n#!/bin/sh zsh -c \u0026#34;source /home/vector/.zshrc \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npx @browsermcp/mcp@latest\u0026#34; (Note: The script directly invokes zsh -c. If using this approach, ensure the script itself is executable and the path to .zshrc is correct.)\nMake the Script Executable: In your WSL terminal:\nchmod +x ~/run_browsermcp.sh (Adjust script name as needed).\nConfigure mcp.json: Modify your mcp.json to execute this script. If your WSL username is vector and you use zsh, and the script is at /home/vector/run_browsermcp.sh:\n{ \u0026#34;mcpServers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;browsermcp-wsl\u0026#34;: { // Give it a descriptive name \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wsl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;zsh\u0026#34;, // Or \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/home/vector/run_browsermcp.sh\u0026#34; // Full path to your script within WSL ], \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true } } } This matches your provided mcp.json structure for browsermcp:\n{ \u0026#34;mcpServers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;browsermcp\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wsl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;zsh\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/home/vector/browsermcp.sh\u0026#34; // Path from your example ] } } } Solution B: Directly Sourcing in mcp.json\nYou can try to source your rc file directly in the args. This can sometimes be less reliable depending on the complexity of your rc file, but it\u0026rsquo;s more concise if it works.\n{ \u0026#34;mcpServers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;my-mcp-server-bash\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wsl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-ic\u0026#34;, // Note: -i for interactive to potentially help source rc files \u0026#34;source ~/.bashrc \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npx @some-mcp/package --port {{port}}\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true }, \u0026#34;my-mcp-server-zsh\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wsl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;zsh\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-ic\u0026#34;, // Note: -i for interactive \u0026#34;source ~/.zshrc \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npx @some-mcp/package --port {{port}}\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true } } } If nvm is used and the above still fails, you might need to provide the absolute path to nvm.sh and the npx executable installed by nvm:\n{ \u0026#34;mcpServers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;my-mcp-nvm-direct\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wsl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34;, // Or \u0026#34;zsh\u0026#34; \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;, // Replace /home/your_user and YOUR_NODE_VERSION appropriately \u0026#34;source /home/your_user/.nvm/nvm.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; /home/your_user/.nvm/versions/node/vXX.YY.Z/bin/npx @some-mcp/package --port {{port}}\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true } } } To find the full path to npx after sourcing nvm.sh and selecting a Node version with nvm use, run which npx in your WSL terminal.\n5. Example: Configuring a Browser Interaction MCP Let\u0026rsquo;s use @browsermcp/mcp as an example, as it\u0026rsquo;s common.\nUsing Solution A (shell script ~/run_browsermcp.sh as defined before):\n{ \u0026#34;mcpServers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;browsermcp-wsl\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wsl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;zsh\u0026#34;, // Or \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; if your script and environment use bash \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/home/YOUR_WSL_USERNAME/run_browsermcp.sh\u0026#34; // Adjust path ], \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;env\u0026#34;: { // Optional: if the MCP server needs specific environment variables // \u0026#34;DEBUG\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; } } } } Remember to replace YOUR_WSL_USERNAME with your actual WSL username.\nVerification After saving mcp.json:\nRestart Cursor or go to Cursor Settings -\u0026gt; Features -\u0026gt; MCP and click the refresh icon next to one of your servers or for all MCP servers. A green dot next to the server name in the MCP settings indicates Cursor has successfully connected to it. You might see a new terminal window pop up (launched by wsl). This window must remain open for the MCP server to function. This is expected behavior when running MCP servers this way. Test the MCP server by asking Cursor to perform an action that uses it (e.g., for @browsermcp/mcp, ask it to \u0026ldquo;take a screenshot of the current browser tab\u0026rdquo; after setting up the companion browser extension). Troubleshooting npx: command not found or wrong Node version: This almost always means the shell environment within WSL isn\u0026rsquo;t being set up correctly. Double-check paths in your shell script or direct command. Ensure nvm is sourced correctly. Try adding export NVM_DIR=\u0026quot;$HOME/.nvm\u0026quot; and [ -s \u0026quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026quot; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\. \u0026quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026quot; explicitly at the start of your script or command string if using nvm. Verify that node and npx are indeed installed in your WSL distribution and accessible after sourcing your rc file. MCP Server Fails to Connect (No Green Dot): Check the output in the WSL terminal window that pops up. It might contain error messages. Ensure the npx command for the MCP server is correct and includes any necessary arguments like --port {{port}}. Some MCPs might auto-assign ports if not specified. Firewall issues: Less common with WSL2\u0026rsquo;s networking model, but ensure Windows Firewall isn\u0026rsquo;t blocking connections to WSL. \u0026ldquo;Blank\u0026rdquo; Terminal Window: As mentioned, a terminal window will open for each MCP server launched via wsl. This is normal. Closing it will stop the MCP server. Conclusion Configuring Cursor to run MCP servers within your WSL environment provides a streamlined and powerful development setup on Windows. By carefully setting up your mcp.json and ensuring your WSL shell environment is correctly sourced, you can seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your Linux-based workflows. The shell script method (Solution A) is generally the most robust way to handle environments managed by tools like nvm.\nHappy coding with Cursor and WSL!
